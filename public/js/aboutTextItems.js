	'I\'m a twenty-three year old programmer living in Austin, Texas. I developed a passion for programming in high school, and I have come a long way since. I embrace new opportunities to learn independently, and I am all about a hands-on approach to development.',
	'Don\'t let my portfolio fool you into thinking I\'m only about coding! It is my fascination with Mathematics that gives rise to my interest in the theoretical aspect of CS. I like to take an analytical approach when solving programming problems. When I\'m away from the keyboard, I like to stay fit, read anything from non-fiction to high fantasy, and play chess.',
	'I aim to develop applications that are scalable, reliable, and mantainable. I like to work with Node and the rich ecosystem of libraries that the NPM offers. I have built apps based on Meteor, Angular, and React. I am comfortable implementing robust unit tests with frameworks like Mocha or Jest. To use, or not to use a relational data model? No problem! I feel confident working with either MongoDB or MySQL.',
	'I strive to implement applications that look and feel great across devices. Anytime design is involved, I let my creativity run free to create elegant interfaces that feature a smooth user experience. When it comes to data visualization, I like to use D3.js or Chart.js. Lately, I\'ve been focused on learning Python! It\'s simple, powerful, and boasts awesome Machine Learning libraries like Tensorflow.'
